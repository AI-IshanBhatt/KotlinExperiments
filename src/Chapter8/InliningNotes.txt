lambdas are normally compiled to anonymous classes.
But that means every time you use a lambda expression, an extra class is created;
and if the lambda captures some variables, then a new object is created on every
invocation. This introduces runtime overhead, causing an implementation that uses a
lambda to be less efficient than a function that executes the same code directly.
