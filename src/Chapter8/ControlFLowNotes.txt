If you use the return keyword in a lambda, it returns from the function in which you called
the lambda, not just from the lambda itself. Such a return statement is called a nonlocal
return, because it returns from a larger block than the block containing the
return statement.

Note that the return from the outer function is possible only if the function that takes
the lambda as an argument is inlined. (foreach is inlined)

Using the return expression in lambdas passed to non-inline functions isn’t allowed.
A non-inline function can save the lambda passed to it in a variable and execute it later, when the function
has already returned, so it’s too late for the lambda to affect when the surrounding function returns.
