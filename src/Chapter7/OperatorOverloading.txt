If your class is immutable, like Point in one of the earlier examples
You should provide only operations that return a new value (such as plus).
If you design a mutable class, like a builder, provide only plusAssign and similar operations.

The Kotlin standard library supports both approaches for collections. The + and -
operators always return a new collection. The += and -= operators work on mutable
collections by modifying them in place, and on read-only collections by returning a
modified copy.

You can use the compareValuesBy function from the Kotlin standard
library to implement the compareTo method easily and concisely. This function
receives a list of callbacks that calculate values to be compared.
