The ability to treat functions as values. Instead of declaring a class and passing an instance
of that class to a function, you can pass a function directly.
With lambda expressions, the code is even more concise. You don’t need to declare a function: instead, you can,
effectively, pass a block of code directly as a function parameter.

Lambdas
1) Use functional interface (Interface having only one method)
2) Use it with collection

Syntax of lambda are similar to the one we used in Java
{x: Int, y: Int -> x + y}

When using lambda on collection follow the rule of thumb.
The simple rule you can follow is to always start without the
types; if the compiler complains, specify them.

If you store a lambda in a variable, there’s no context from which to infer the parameter
types,
val getAge = {p: NewPerson -> p.age}
people.maxBy(getAge)

ACCESSIBILITY RULES
If you use a lambda in a function, you can access the
parameters of that function as well as the local variables declared before the lambda.

External variables accessed from a lambda, such as prefix, clientErrors,
and serverErrors in these examples, are said to be captured by the lambda.

IMP TO NOTE:-
Note that, by default, the lifetime of a local variable is constrained by the function
in which the variable is declared. But if it’s captured by the lambda, the code that uses
this variable can be stored and executed later.
