// They are JAVA's streams, basically they are lazy Nothing will be computed until a terminal operation is performed.
// You can convert any collection to a sequence by calling the extension function asSequence.
// You call toList for backward conversion.

/*
NOTE As a rule, use a sequence whenever you have a chain of operations on a
large collection. In section 8.2, weâ€™ll discuss why eager operations on regular
collections are efficient in Kotlin, in spite of creating intermediate collections.
But if the collection contains a large number of elements, the intermediate
rearranging of elements costs a lot, so lazy evaluation is preferable.

Intermediate - map, filter, flatMap
Terminal - toList, first(), any(), find()

In collection, everything is first mapped, then filtered
In Sequence, first element is mapped, filtered, then 2nd and so on.
So if the desired result is returned after only 2 elements, rest will never be mapped
PARALLEL SEQUENCE IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
